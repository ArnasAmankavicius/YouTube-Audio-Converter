## Changes
* **Dependency added:** validators, 0.18.2. Checks if the provided input is a valid URL or a path to a file.
* Added the ability to provide either a single link or a file containing YouTube links.
* Made the export path optional. By default, it will try to write to the current directory if no path provided.
* Created an epilog with author information.
* Code refractoring to remove non-needed variables.
* Renamed __version__.py to __info__.py since now it contains some basic information.
