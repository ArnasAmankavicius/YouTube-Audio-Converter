# Youtube_to_mp3

Downloads specified YouTube videos and converts them into a specified .mp3 format.

### Prerequisites

- You will need Python version 3.9.0 for this to function. (Later versions not tested as of yet)
- setuptools
- [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
- pip3
- [ffmpeg](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub#getting-ffmpeg-set-up) (Click on the link to see how to setup ffmpeg on different platforms)

## Installing the required 

On Mac with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install python@3.9
```
For other systems:
```
To install go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the respective files for your OS.
```

You will also need to install 'setuptools' in order for the build to work.
```bash
pip3 install setuptools
```
## Installing

To run the code, go to the code directory and execute the following.
```bash
python3 setup build && python3 setup install && audiodl
```
This will both install the required prerequisites and launch the application.

To set the videos that are needed go to links.txt and add the links seperating each link by a new line:
```
Link #1
Link #2
```

The output should be something like this:
```zsh
‚ùØ audiodl

[ SUCCESS ] 'Video File 2' converted!
[ SUCCESS ] 'Video File 1' converted!
[ SUCCESS ] See /Users/user/Downloads/Converted_Videos for converted audio.
```

## Changing location configuration

You can change the directory where the songs.txt file is located. In addition, you can change the download locations for YouTube downloads and conversions inside the *main.py* file.
```python
c = Config(
  verbose=True,
  yt_dl_path=Path.home().as_posix() + "/Downloads/Downloaded_Videos", <- YouTube downloads location
  convert_path=Path.home().as_posix() + "/Downloads/Converted_Videos", <- Converted file location
  workers=5,
  out_format=".mp3"
)
link_file = Path.home().as_posix() + "/Downloads/links.txt"
```
By default on MacOS, YouTube downloads are at: */Users/user/Downloads/Downloaded_Videos*, converted files are located at: */Users/user/Downloads/Converted_Videos*, and links.txt is located at: */Users/user/Downloads/*

> For now this is the way to add links for downloads. Future updates will make it easier.
